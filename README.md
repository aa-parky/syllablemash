## What is Syllabication?

The division of words into syllables, either in speech or in writing.

### FAQ

+ What are the main rules of Syllabification?

The main rules of syllabication are:

* If a word contains a pair of consonants, the syllabic demarcation in the word should divide those two consonants.
* If a word contains a series of sequential consonants, consonants that work together to make a sound (or blend) should be kept together.
* If a word contains a singular consonant situated between vowels, syllabic divide should occur after the first vowel and then prior to the subsequent consonant.
* If a word contains a pair of consonants sandwiched by vowels, syllabication occurs between the consonants.
* If a word contains a pair of vowels that each produce a separate sound, the syllabic divide is between the vowels.

+ What is Syllabication in phonics?

Syllabication is the process of decoding different words based on their sounds and vowel/consonant ordering. 
Phonics is the larger process of decoding words into their sounds in order to successfully read them as whole words.
